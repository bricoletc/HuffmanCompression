File compression using Huffman Coding.

This is a C++ Implementation of the Huffman Compression algorithm.
It is implemented following the guidelines given in the CS106B course at Stanford: https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1172//assn/huffman.html

See pdf in project files for detailed description.


* To compile: `g++ *.cpp -I ../lib/StanfordCPPLib/`

###Â TODOs:

* freeTree function for deallocating Huffman Nodes
